    question: "What do you mean by 2 factor authentication?",
    answer: "Normally, NOUN gives her students the ability to login to their portal with just their email and password, if you’re one of those students who are very conscious about personal information security, then this isn’t convenient for you. With NOUNITE, we give you full control of who can and who cannot access your account, thereby having access to your information. With our 2FA feature, you get notified via SMS or email anytime there’s an attempt to login to your account on a new device, this way you’ll always know who’s logged in on your account."
